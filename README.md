# kumbaya.dev

_Light a Fire. Gather Around. Build Together._

## Overview

**kumbaya.dev** is a positive‑energy, community-driven accountability platform for indie hackers, solopreneurs, and builders. It celebrates the art of showing up - turning consistent progress into a shared and celebrated practice, helping indie hackers, solopreneurs, and creatives stay accountable through _public intention_, _supportive peers_, and _visible progress_.

Its mission is to replace toxic hustle culture with _positive accountability_—a sense of _warmth, belonging,_ and _shared purpose._

## The Campfire Metaphor

Everything in Kumbaya is framed through the metaphor of **a campfire in the dark, surrounded by people creating warmth together.**
