![SvelteKit Omakase](https://res.cloudinary.com/nshemesh/image/upload/v1717396211/Sveltekit%20Omakase/meta.png)

Welcome to **SvelteKit Omakase** (formerly Kickoff SvelteKit), a starter project designed to get you up and running with SvelteKit 🚀.

This project embraces an _omakase_ approach, inspired by the [Rails doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine#omakase).
It offers an opinionated selection of tools and a structured approach, providing a robust foundation while allowing you the flexibility to customize and extend it as needed.

## Notes

> If you are looking for the archived Postgres-compatible version, please check the V1 branch. However, please be aware that this version is no longer maintained. We highly recommend using the new and improved SvelteKit Omakase version, which features significant enhancements and will be regularly maintained. Transitioning to this version is straightforward and offers a better development experience compared to the older version.
