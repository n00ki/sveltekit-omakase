Welcome to **SvelteKit Omakase**, a starter project designed to get you up and running with SvelteKit 🚀.

This project embraces an _omakase_ approach, inspired by the [Rails doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine#omakase).
It offers an opinionated selection of tools and a structured approach, providing a robust foundation while allowing you the flexibility to customize and extend it as needed.
